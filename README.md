# EDA Project on IPL Data
EDA is Exploratory Data Analysis and is one of the most important subfield of Data Science.
## __What is Exploratory Data Analysis ?__
In Exploratory Data Analysis we explore the data as a part of analyzing it. We mostly use graphical techniques to do the same.
It is one of the very important step which brings up confidence in the data that can go for Machine learning.
Below Diagram depicts exactly what the entire flow of Data Science Process and highlights the EDA step.
